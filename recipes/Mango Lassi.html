    <p>
        Mango lassi is a popular, creamy, and refreshing drink originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is typically made with yogurt, ripe mangoes, sugar, water or milk, and sometimes cardamom or other spices. The mangoes lend the lassi a sweet and tangy flavor, while the yogurt provides a probiotic boost and a cool, thick texture. Mango lassi is often enjoyed as a beverage after a meal or on a hot day.

        There are many variations of mango lassi, depending on the region and personal preferences. Some people prefer it thick and yogurt-heavy, while others like it thinner and more milk-based. Some recipes also include additional ingredients like saffron, rosewater, or nuts.
